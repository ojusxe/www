## ojus.fyi

my personal corner of the internet where i dump thoughts, digital art, projects, and occasionally good ideas

## what's here

- some past projects that didn't completely break
- a dreamspace gallery for visual stuff
- random musings and links
- probably too much anime and pop soundtrack integration
- bookmarks

### built with

next.js, tailwind, sanity cms, and whatever else seemed like a good idea

### local dev

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

then pray it works on your machine too
