      <p>i taught myself to code summer of 6th grade.</p>

      <p>i &quot;launched&quot; my first app, lemonayd (<a href="https://www.lemonaid.com/">lemonaid</a> was taken) later that year.</p>

      <p>it was a fundraising app for schools. i became one of the youngest winners of the <a href="https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/">congressional app challenge</a> from my submission.</p>

      <p>i recently got into startups (mid-2023) after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VDZRR07Eqw">this video</a>.</p>

      <p>one of my earliest ambitions was to &quot;invent&quot; something. the idea of creating things that other people could use seemed pretty interesting.</p>

      <p>i always knew this is what i wanted to do.</p>
