      <p>i&apos;ve never really been driven by money. i read this on a fortune cookie from panda express a few years back. something like &quot;money is a means to an end, not the end itself&quot;.</p>

      <p>for now, i do it for the love of the game. i&apos;m always trying to be the best i can in everything i do.</p>

      <p>i&apos;ve been fortunate enough to never have to worry about food, money, housing, or education. so maybe this changes in the future. but i wasn&apos;t after fancy cars or nice watches like most people around my age.</p>

      <p>i think this mindset is becoming more common, but i&apos;d like to get to a point where i can live without having to worry about money.</p>

      <p>no mansion or private jet. i&apos;d just keep it simple.</p>
